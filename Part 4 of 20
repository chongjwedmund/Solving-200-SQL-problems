-- Maximize Prime Item Inventory [Amazon SQL Interview Question]
-- Amazon wants to maximize the number of items it can stock in a 500,000 square feet warehouse.

-- Output the item type with prime_eligible followed by not_prime and the maximum number of items that can be stocked.

-- Median Google Search Frequency [Google SQL Interview Question]
-- Google's marketing team is making a Superbowl commercial and needs a simple statistic to put on their TV ad: the median number of searches a person made last year.
-- However, at Google scale, querying the 2 trillion searches is too costly. 
-- Luckily, you have access to the summary table which tells you the number of searches made last year and how many Google users fall into that bucket.
-- Write a query to report the median of searches made by a user. Round the median to one decimal point.

with cte as 
(select searches 
from search_frequency 
group by searches, generate_series(1,num_users)
order by searches)

select round(percentile_cont(0.5) within group(order by searches)::decimal,1) median

-- The output should include the user ID and their current payment status, sorted by the user id.

select user_id,
case when paid is null then 'CHURN'
when status = 'CHURN' and paid is not null then 'RESURRECT'
when status is null then 'NEW'
else 'EXISTING' end new_status
